# Mission Statement
We research methods and develop tools to intercept the inherent tradeoff between quality and security, time, and resources in industrial-scale environments. Our philosophy epitomizes continuous, collaborative, constructive, and analytical quality assurance in IT management, software engineering, and systems operation. Our goal is to develop foundational, yet practicable solutions that are evaluated in industrial contexts.
