          <p class="mt-4 intro-text">Quality Engineering (QE) is a research group at the Department of Computer Science at Universität Innsbruck. QE strives for end-to-end quality management of IT systems in the context of today´s rapid digital transformation.</p>                                                             
          <p class="text-content">We research methods and develop tools to intercept the inherent tradeoff between quality and security, time, and resources in industrial-scale environments. Our philosophy epitomizes continuous, collaborative, constructive, and analytical quality assurance in IT management, software engineering, and systems operation. Our goal is to develop foundational, yet practicable solutions that are evaluated in industrial contexts.</p>                    
          <!--Digital Twin -->
          <h4>Model-driven Digital Twin Engineering</h4>
          <p class="text-content">Digital twins have turned process-based lifecycle management of cyber-physical systems into platform-based informed decision-making. Our research aims at establishing model-driven engineering methods for gestating and evolving stakeholder-aligned digital twins for holistic monitoring, control, and optimization by capitalizing on pervasive computing.</p>
          <!--Security Engineering -->
          <h4>Security Engineering</h4>
          <p class="text-content">The increasingly persistent and sophisticated threat actors along with the sheer speed at which cyber-attacks unfold, make timely decision-making imperative for the security of an organization’s system. Our research aims to develop methods and solutions for automatically triggering security processes that establish appropriate security controls in a timely manner to ensure the functionality of systems and prevent misuse and malicious behavior.</p>  
          <!--Cloud Engineering -->
          <h4>Security Engineering</h4>
          <p class="text-content">Enterprises are digitizing their complex business processes atop of cloud services of various cloud providers. Our research aims at automated end-to-end support for digital transformation of applications and services in federated clouds, including interoperability, portability, and quality assurance.</p>
