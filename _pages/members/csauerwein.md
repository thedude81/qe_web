After we have agreed on a master’s thesis topic, you are asked to write an exposè. Details on how to write a good exposè can be found here.
If we have agreed on a bachelor's thesis topic, your are asked to present your planned work in the "Seminar mit Bachelorarbeit". Details on how to prepare a good initial presentation can be found here.
